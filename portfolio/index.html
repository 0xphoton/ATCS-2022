        <p>Student | Athlete | Intern Software Developer</p> <!--Words-->
        <p class="description">I am a student at the Menlo School, software development intern during the summer, and cross country athlete. 
            I grew up primarily in the California Bay Area, although I've also lived in Europe and the Pacific Northwest. 
            I mostly code crypto-related projects, but I've also worked 
            with Machine Learning and Data Science. </p>
        
        <p class="description">I started coding in third grade with Scratch, and in fourth grade moved to HTML and some basic Python. I've pretty much stuck
            with Python ever since, although I also really enjoy coding in Solidity and Java. I love buildings tools to work with and generate insights about data. 
        </p>

        <p class="description">In my free time, when I'm not coding or learning about crypto, I love endurance running, learning new languages, 
            and playing Polytopia and Genshin Impact with my friends. 
        </p>
